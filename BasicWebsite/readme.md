# 📄 Basic Website – HTML Demo

Welcome to my **very basic** static website project. This was created to demonstrate fundamental frontend concepts using only HTML. No CSS frameworks, no JavaScript — just raw, honest `<div>` energy.

## 🚀 What is this?

A super minimal website consisting of:
- A navigation bar  
- Some structured content (like a company overview)  
- A contact section  

All built with plain HTML, the way your ancestors intended.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS

## 🔍 File Structure


## 📷 Preview

Open `Basic.htm` in your browser. You know the drill — double click or right-click > open in browser.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as:
- A warm-up for future frontend development  
- A test bed for layout structure and content hierarchy  
- A reminder that every frontend journey starts with `<html>`

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Page structuring with semantic HTML tags  
- Writing clean and readable markup
